# hello-world

Hi everyone! My name is Rebecca Noelle Jackson. I'm a Marketing and Management of Information Systems undergraduate at Temple University. I've always been interested in coding - I'm hoping GitHub will make my group coding projects a lot easier. So far, I've worked in HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, Java & Javascript.
